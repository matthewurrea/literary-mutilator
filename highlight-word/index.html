		These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out
		new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the homing signal.
		Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors
		show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has
		increased by 3,000 percent.

		We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by
		which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if
		I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal
		energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

		Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown
		microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's
		biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering
		section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable
		by your transporter.

		Resistance is futile.
